This project is a library management system and provides management of users, staff, books, authors, categories and borrowing transactions. Add, Edit and Delete methods, which are basic operations for users, ledgers and other records, are defined. Interfaces provide form fields where users can easily perform these operations.

There are different form pages within the project: for users, for books, for authors, for categories and for loans. Each form lists the details of the relevant data type and allows users to edit these details.

Especially for users, the visual upload feature has been integrated. Users can upload their own images and set one of these images as the default. The image upload process begins with a user-friendly file selection dialog. The selected images are displayed in the user interface as PictureBox and CheckBox components and are saved in the database.

The project includes all the basic functions required for library management and allows users to effectively manage database records.
